              The Log-Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) antenna has been successfully
              designed and simulated across multiple operational frequencies,
              including 433 MHz, 900 MHz, 1200 MHz, 1500 MHz, 2400 MHz, and 5800
              MHz. This antenna is developed to support an anti-drone system
              with multi-mode and multi-frequency jamming capabilities. With its
              wide frequency coverage, the antenna can effectively interfere
              with various drone communication and control signals, enhancing
              the effectiveness of drone threat mitigation in diverse
              operational scenarios
